After 10 years without a bike, I finally got my hands on a gravel bike.
I wasn't aware how much I missed biking!

# How I got back to biking

In my youth I often used my bike and even later during my time in Berlin,
going by bike was a great feeling. Well, thinking of Berlin: that's where
my bike was stolen. Nothing dramatic, but I also didn't replace it. Until now.

A few years ago we moved from Berlin to Bonn, and I luckily
continued to work remotely for the company in Berlin.
Well, that's the good part.
The bad part: I looked at the same walls for 99% of the time,
so after some years of going fully-remote I needed a change.
I changed the employer with a focus on their office to be
right around the corner.

Now I am less than half an hour away from the office, so I can
choose on a daily basis whether to stay at home (some days are
heavily influenced by my kids), or go to the office and meet
my colleagues.

This is very convenient and also opened the door to go by bike again.
Many companies like my current employer provide benefits like [Jobrad](https://www.jobrad.org/),
which was a great chance for me to consider a more advanced and fun bike
without the need to rob a bank :)

# Choosing a bike

I researched bike options and found one at [Canyon](https://www.canyon.com/),
with their headquarters quite near - along with a showroom and the possibility
to test several bike models. They also provide a good consultation
without expecting you to instantly buy a bike!
That helped a lot to decide between a more sensible (a pure commuting bike
like the [Canyon Commuter](https://www.canyon.com/en-de/hybrid-bikes/commuter-bikes/commuter/commuter-al-cf/))
and a more exciting decision (a bikepacking/gravel bike like the [Canyon Grizl](https://www.canyon.com/en-de/gravel-bikes/bike-packing/grizl/al/)).

After a night's sleep I ordered the [Grizl 7 AL](https://www.canyon.com/en-de/gravel-bikes/bike-packing/grizl/al/grizl-7/2709.html?dwvar_2709_pv_rahmenfarbe=VT%2FBK),
applied for leasing via Jobrad and sent my employer the form to approve the
Jobrad as a new "Dienstwagen". By the way: I ordered on Saturday and received
the bike after only 6 days. I really didn't expect the whole process
to work so well! Canyon does a great job of preparing the bike, so that I required less than
an hour to assemble it and go for the first test ride.

During the next weekend I already checked the tour to the office:
not riding a bike for the last 10 years, I wanted to ensure that the route
to the office would work for me and my level of fitness.
Let's put it like this: there aren't any steep tracks between my home
and the office - and the route itself, crossing the Rhine, is quite enjoyable.

# The bike is not enough

The season is probably not the best one to start biking, but the unsteady weather
also helps to think about additional gear, especially the right clothes.
Ten years ago, I might not have considered to even gather information
about "how to ride a bike", but in times of information overload via
internet and social media, it was just too easy to learn about the
options, requirements, tips, and tricks.

There are great videos at YouTube, for example the German channel by
[Anke is Awesome](https://www.youtube.com/@AnkeisAwesome). Anke tells
you down-to-earth about the relevant bits and answered more or less
all of my questions. Leveraging YouTube's recommendation algorithm
(in a positive way), I watched several other videos and channels,
sometimes about required gear for shorter versus longer trips,
challenges like [Brevet or Randonneuring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randonneuring),
and I became also curious for bike backing.

# Going (biking) all-in

Long story short: I guess I'm going all-in and I'll keep inspirational
stories by [Giant Cheerio](https://www.youtube.com/@giantcheerio)
and [Wiebke LÃ¼hmann](https://www.youtube.com/@wiebkelueh) in my mind.
Yet, before going on a ride of 10.000km, I'll start with a Brevet of 200km
or a tour up and down the hills to the [Westerwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerwald).
Other channels by [GCN auf Deutsch](https://www.youtube.com/@gcnaufdeutsch)
and [Bastian Brutzer](https://www.youtube.com/@BastianBrutzer91)
will certainly help with their tips and tricks, and I will certainly
go for shorter/easier rides to [Cologne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne)
and [Koblenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koblenz).

I'll keep you updated!
