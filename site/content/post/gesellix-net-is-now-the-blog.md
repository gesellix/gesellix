Those who know my [old web site](http://gesellix.de/) might wonder what gesellix.net is about.

Well, [gesellix.de](http://gesellix.de/) wasn't very frequently updated with new content or posts and I guess it was in parts due to the [Joomla! CMS](http://www.joomla.org/) being too much distraction when writing just a little blog post. Joomla is fine as CMS, I still like it for the massive amount of extensions and for the great community behind it. Yet, [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) makes creating content much easier for me. So I decided to use a Ghost based blog as my new primary channel to publish ideas, projects or random thoughts.

My old web site will be online for a while, at least as long as I support my Joomla extensions [TitleLink](http://gesellix.github.io/titlelink/) and [Shortlink](http://gesellix.github.io/shortlink/).
