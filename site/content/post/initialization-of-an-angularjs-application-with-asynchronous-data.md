A recently published [article](http://blog-it.hypoport.de/2013/10/28/angularjs-ordered-init-async-promise/) shows our solution to initialize an [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) application using promises. You might have similar problems when your application initialization depends on http responses or other ansynchronous tasks.

An [online demo](http://jsfiddle.net/gesellix/xxKjw/) can be found at jsfiddle.net and the code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/hypoport/angularjs-initservice).
