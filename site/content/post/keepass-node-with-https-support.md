[Keepass-Node](https://github.com/gesellix/keepass-node) now supports ssl/https. You only need to provide your server key and certificate and browse the KeePass-Node instance via `https://...`.

Another feature to make KeePass-Node sync with a Google Drive file has been added, too. Currently there's only read support.

Please see the updated [readme](https://github.com/gesellix/keepass-node/blob/master/README.md) for details and configuration.
