This blog is about development topics, with a focus on software development in Java and JavaScript. Recently used frameworks and tools are the omnipresent ones like [Spring](http://spring.io/), [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), but I also like to play with other well known tools like [Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org/) and [CouchDB](http://wicket.apache.org/).

You may find me on the internet on several platforms like [GitHub](http://github.com/gesellix) using my alias "gesellix". As an employee at [Hypoport AG](http://www.hypoport.de/) in Berlin I sometimes blog at their [IT blog](http://blog-it.hypoport.de/). There you'll find some exciting content of my colleagues, too! The best way to contact me would be at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gesellix).
