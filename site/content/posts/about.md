You found my blog about development topics. Well, if you'd like to know more about the person behind this blog, here are some details regarding my developer life:

I started with Assembler, went through Pascal and (Visual) Basic, had some C, C++ and PHP at high school and currently use Java and JavaScript as languages of choice. I've been using Java for over 10 years now, though I'm still trying keep up to date with new (or refreshed) concepts, languages and tools.

After my employment at [Hypoport](http://www.hypoport.de/), working with a great team on a German finance integration platform, I'm working at [Small Improvements](https://www.small-improvements.com/) on a tool to help people perform reviews and improve communication.

Current projects include such hipster tools like AngularJS, Spring Boot, Gradle, Ansible, Docker, and Prometheus. In my free time I'm hacking on a similar technology stack (including the good ol' Wicket and Node.js), but always trying to push the limits and experiment with new concepts. Most (sometimes not so final) results are visible at my [GitHub](https://github.com/gesellix) account.

If you'd like to get in touch, have a look at the [contact](http://gesellix.net/contact/) page.
