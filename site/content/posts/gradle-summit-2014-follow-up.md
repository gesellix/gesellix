Probably a bit late, but private life is more important :)

You can find the slides of my talk for the [Gradle Summit 2014](http://gradlesummit.com/conference/santa_clara/2014/06/home) online at [http://gesellix.github.io/gradle-summit-2014/](http://gesellix.github.io/gradle-summit-2014/). The video ist available at [YouTube](http://youtu.be/EJJkXrkT40g) along with the other Gradle Summit videos.

In case you're interested in details regarding our implementation of a deployment pipeline using Gradle and Docker (2nd part of the Gradle Summit talk), please follow this blog or my employer's [IT blog](http://blog-it.hypoport.de/). If you're near Germany in November, you might consider visiting the [Continuous Lifecycle 2014](http://continuouslifecycle.de/) conference where I'm going to [talk](http://continuouslifecycle.de/lecture.php?id=4541) about our pipeline in more detail.
