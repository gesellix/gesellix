Great news: I'm going to speak at the [Gradle Summit 2014](http://gradlesummit.com/conference/santa_clara/2014/06/home) in Santa Clara. This will be the very first talk I'll give in public so I'm quite excited!

My talk will have two parts, with the first one about how we migrated a Maven multi-module project of 300 pom.xml files to [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/). The second part will show you how we currently use Gradle in combination with [Docker](https://www.docker.io/) to continuously deploy a product of the [EUROPACE 2](http://www.europace.de/) platform to production.

You might occasionally check my [employer's blog](http://blog-it.hypoport.de/) where my team and other co-workers also post some related stuff. Details regarding the Gradle Summit talk are available at the [Schedule](http://gradlesummit.com/conference/santa_clara/2014/06/schedule).
