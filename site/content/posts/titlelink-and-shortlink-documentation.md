The Joomla! TitleLink and Shortlink extension documentation can be found at [http://gesellix.github.io/titlelink/](http://gesellix.github.io/titlelink/) and [http://gesellix.github.io/shortlink/](http://gesellix.github.io/shortlink/).

Cleaning my homepage also meant cleaning up content, so I prefer not to have several copies of the same document in different places. Old links probably still refer to this homepage, so please update your links to use the official location. Thanks!

Due to changed focus away from Joomla, but towards Node.js, AngularJS and other tools of that environment, i've been quite inactive on the Joomla extensions. Another extension named [Mailman subscription module](https://github.com/gesellix/listsubscribe) is only available in the GitHub source repository and didn't get a dedicated project page.

But I still have Joomla on my watch list which also means that I don't like to stop supporting users of TitleLink or the other extensions. So you can at least use the issue tracker when something doesn't work as expected. You can find the project pages at the following urls:

* [TitleLink](https://github.com/gesellix/titlelink)
* [Shortlink](https://github.com/gesellix/shortlink)
* [Mailman ListSubscribe](https://github.com/gesellix/listsubscribe)
